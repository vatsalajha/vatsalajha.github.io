# Hello World! I'm Vatsala Jha 👋

## Full-Stack Developer | AI Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner 🚀

Welcome to my digital playground! I'm on a mission to turn caffeine into code and dreams into deployments. 

### 🎓 Education
- **MS in Computer Science** @ Rutgers University (Expected 2025)
- **BE in Computer Science** @ PES University (2021)

### 💼 Experience
I've worn many hats, but my favorite is the debugging wizard hat!

- **Software Engineer** @ Cohesity
  - Slayed bugs, built APIs, and made databases sing in harmony
  - Automated all the things (because who likes repetitive tasks?)
  - Created dashboards that made data look like modern art

### 🛠️ Tech Toolbox
- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C++, R, SQL
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, D3.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, AWS, MongoDB
- **DevOps:** Git, Docker, Jenkins, CI/CD

### 🚀 Projects
- **Government Fund Tracking Platform**
  - Because transparency is the new black in governance!
- **Road Trip Planner**
  - For when you want to take the scenic route (and avoid traffic)

### 🌱 Currently Growing
- My skills in AI and Machine Learning
- A caffeine tolerance that would impress a barista

### 🎨 When I'm Not Coding
- Mentoring the next generation of code wizards
- Dreaming up the next big app idea (probably involving cats or pizza)
- Hiking or planning to hike somewhere

Remember, in the world of coding, there are 10 types of people: those who understand binary, and those who don't. 😉
